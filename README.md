## 🚀 What Is This?

**Web Dev Projects** is a community-driven repository where developers, especially first-time contributors, can submit their own **static web projects** built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

Every accepted project is automatically discovered by GitHub Actions and showcased on the live website.

This repository serves as:

- **A practice ground** for Git, GitHub, branching and pull requests.
- **A portfolio platform** where every contributor gets visible credit.
- **A launchpad** for open-source programs such as NSoC, GSSoC, GSoC and Hacktoberfest.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```text
Projects/
  Notes App/
    README.md
    project.json
    index.html
    style.css
    script.js
```

### Submission Flow

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Add a folder inside **Projects/** using **Title Case with spaces**.
3. Include your project files along with:
   - **README.md**
   - **project.json**
4. Open a Pull Request.
5. After approval, the showcase updates automatically.

### Folder Naming Example

✅ To Do Web App

❌ to-do-web-app

❌ to_do_web_app

❌ todowebapp

Full contribution rules and the **project.json schema** are available in **CONTRIBUTING.md**.

Reading it before opening a PR helps keep reviews fast and the repository clean.

## 📄 project.json Template

Every project must include a **project.json** file inside its project folder.

Use the template below and update the values according to your project:

```json
{
  "title": "2048 Game",
  "description": "The classic 2048 puzzle with keyboard and swipe input, smooth tile transitions and best-score persistence.",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "github": "github-username"
  },
  "tags": [
    "game",
    "canvas-free",
    "vanilla-js"
  ],
  "entry": "index.html",
  "thumbnail": "thumbnail.svg"
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| title | ✅ | Name of your project |
| description | ✅ | Short summary shown on the showcase page |
| author.name | ✅ | Your display name |
| author.github | ✅ | Your GitHub username only |
| tags | ✅ | Relevant keywords describing your project |
| entry | ✅ | Main HTML file, usually `index.html` |
| thumbnail | ✅ | Preview image shown on the showcase |

### Before Opening a Pull Request

- Ensure all fields are filled correctly.
- Verify that **entry** points to an existing file.
- Verify that **thumbnail** exists inside your project folder.
- Keep descriptions concise and meaningful.
- Use relevant tags so users can discover your project easily.

> [!TIP]
> The easiest approach is to copy the **project.json** from any existing project, update the values, and place it inside your own project folder.

## 📦 Example Projects

These projects are included as references so you can understand the expected structure and quality.

| Project | Highlights |
|----------|------------|

## 🌐 Showcase Website

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The root **index.html** powers the live showcase website.

>
> **.github/workflows/index-projects.yml**

> [!WARNING]
> Never edit **projects.json** manually.
>
> Add your project folder and let the automation handle everything else.

The showcase is deployed using **GitHub Pages** directly from the **main** branch.
